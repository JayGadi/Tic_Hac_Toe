# Tic_Hac_Toe
Tic Tac Toe android app that allows for users to play Tic Tac Toe via bluetooth. 

App allows users to play a single player game locally, a multi-player game locally, and a multi-player game via bluetooth. 
This app was a way for me to learn how the bluetooth api works, so I put a new spin on a classic game. I decided to also make a local single player and multiplayer version, to improve my logical thinking. Game was degined to look like a notebook doodle, and the font and markers a designed to look like pen writing.
